# Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm, a soft clustering technique where data points can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. It includes customizable parameters, data visualization, and performance metrics, making it ideal for exploring and analyzing fuzzy clustering concepts.
