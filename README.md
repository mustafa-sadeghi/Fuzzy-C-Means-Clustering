# Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook implements the **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** clustering algorithm, a soft clustering method where data points belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.

## Features
- Step-by-step implementation of FCM.
- Visual representation of clustering results.
- Customizable parameters (e.g., number of clusters, fuzziness coefficient).
- Membership matrix and centroid calculations.
- Adaptable to different datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the `fuzzy-cmeans.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Replace or use the sample dataset.
3. Set parameters:
   - Number of clusters (`c`)
   - Fuzziness coefficient (`m`)
   - Convergence threshold
   - Maximum iterations
4. Execute the cells to preprocess data, run FCM, and visualize clusters.
5. Analyze the membership matrix and cluster centroids.

## Example
Demonstrates clustering on a 2D dataset, showing how data points are assigned partial memberships to clusters. Suitable for applications in bioinformatics, image processing, and more.

## Future Work
- Add visualizations for higher dimensions.
- Compare with hard clustering algorithms like K-Means.
- Optimize for large datasets with parallel processing.
